# 2nodes2seconds (2n2s)
*Thanks to [2bored2wait](https://github.com/themoonisacheese/2bored2wait.git). This project plans to fix many of the weird issues that come with that one.*

This is a proxy service which simply waits out the queue of 2b2t and even keep you connected if you get disconnected for any reason.

# Installation
1. You'll need to install node.js (tested with v14.13.0, your mileage may vary)
2. `git clone` or download this repository and extract it to a directory.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. Edit the configuration file to your liking and then edit the secrets file to contain your credentials. If you are wary, **audit the sources** to make sure your credentials aren't being stolen.

# Usage
1. Run `node index`.
2. Navigate to your IP (or localhost) on the port you set (default 8090) for web, let it start on its own, or check the discord bot. 

# Notice
This may be buggy. Just be careful there and report any bugs by creating an issue. Thanks.
Also, randoms.js may contain vulgar content you may not agree with. Remove its contents if you wish.
